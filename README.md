# **Happy Birthday Jayita!**

I just want you to know that this is what i meant when I said I planned something for your birthday. I have assorted letters for you in this website which I want you to read when you feel a certain emotion. I know this isn't something really beautiful or elegant but this is the best that I can come up with in this short period of time (I had never built a website before so I learnt a lot too!)

I hope you will enjoy everything that I have for you here!
